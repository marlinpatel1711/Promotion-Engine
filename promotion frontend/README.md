üìò Overview
A Promotion Engine is a flexible, scalable microservice designed to handle various types of discount rules (like percentage off, fixed discounts, buy X get Y, etc.) and apply them at the product, cart, or order level.
This document provides a complete guide for designing, building, and integrating the engine with any e-commerce platform (custom, Shopify, etc.).

3. üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
‚Ä¢	Microservice-based (Node.js, Express)
‚Ä¢	Configurable JSON-based rules
‚Ä¢	Exposed via REST APIs
‚Ä¢	DB: PostgreSQL or MongoDB (via Prisma)
‚Ä¢	Integratable with any e-commerce frontend/backend
________________________________________
4. üß± Minimal & Scalable Database Schema
Designed with as few tables as possible for simplicity and flexibility
Tables:
‚Ä¢	promotions
id: string
name: string
type: enum (percentage, fixed, bxgy, etc.)
rule_json: JSON
start_date: Date
end_date: Date
is_active: boolean
client_id: string (multi-tenant)
created_by, updated_by: string
tags: string[]
‚Ä¢	clients
id: string
name: string
domain: string
api_key: string
metadata: JSON
‚Ä¢	applied_promotions
id: string
promotion_id: FK
order_id: string
client_id: FK
cart_snapshot: JSON
final_discount_amount: number
evaluated_at: Date
________________________________________
5. üß† Rule Definition Schema (JSON)
Flexible schema stored in rule_json
{
  "conditions": [
    { "field": "cart_total", "operator": ">", "value": 5000 },
    { "field": "user_segment", "operator": "=", "value": "GOLD" }
  ],
  "actions": [
    { "type": "percentage", "value": 10 }
  ]
}
‚Ä¢	Field types: cart_total, user_segment, payment_method, product_ids, etc.
‚Ä¢	Operators: =, !=, >, <, in, not_in
‚Ä¢	Action types: percentage, fixed, free_item, set_price
________________________________________
6. ‚öôÔ∏è Promotion Evaluation Flow
1.	Client sends request to /evaluate endpoint with cart data
2.	Engine fetches active rules for the client
3.	Conditions are matched using rule engine
4.	If valid, action is applied and discount is returned
________________________________________
7. üîÅ Example Promotion Flow
Scenario: First-time buyer gets ‚Çπ500 off on ‚Çπ5000+
Backend Admin:
‚Ä¢	Create rule via POST /rules
{
  "client_id": "store_123",
  "name": "First Timer Deal",
  "type": "fixed",
  "rule_json": {
    "conditions": [
      { "field": "user.is_first_order", "operator": "=", "value": true },
      { "field": "cart.total", "operator": ">=", "value": 5000 }
    ],
    "actions": [
      { "type": "fixed", "value": 500 }
    ]
  }
}
Frontend (Cart Page):
‚Ä¢	On cart update, call /evaluate
POST /evaluate
{
  "client_id": "store_123",
  "user": { "id": "u1", "is_first_order": true },
  "cart": { "total": 5600, "items": [...] }
}
Response:
{
  "applied": true,
  "discount": 500,
  "new_total": 5100,
  "promotion_id": "promo_abc123"
}
Frontend:
‚Ä¢	Show: ‚úÖ ‚Äú‚Çπ500 Discount Applied - First Order!‚Äù

‚Ä¢	GET /rules/:id - View rule
‚Ä¢	PUT /rules/:id - Update rule
‚Ä¢	DELETE /rules/:id - Soft delete
üîç Evaluation:
‚Ä¢	POST /evaluate - Evaluate rules on cart
üõí Apply Discount:
‚Ä¢	POST /apply - Save discount applied to cart/order
üîÑ Webhooks:
‚Ä¢	POST /webhook/orders - Track post-order to store applied promotions
üîë Authentication:
‚Ä¢	POST /auth/token - Issue token for clients

9. üß© Frontend Components
üõ† Admin Panel UI
‚Ä¢	Rule Builder Form
o	Conditions UI (dropdowns, values)
o	Action UI (discount type, value)
o	Preview section
‚Ä¢	Rules List View
‚Ä¢	Create/Edit Rule Page
üõç Client Dashboard
‚Ä¢	Promotions List
‚Ä¢	Promotion Effect Analytics
‚Ä¢	Active vs Expired tab
‚ö° Embedded Widget (Custom App/Shopify)
‚Ä¢	Discount Banner on Cart Page
‚Ä¢	Auto Apply on Checkout
‚Ä¢	Evaluation Trigger (AJAX call to /evaluate)
________________________________________
10. üì¶ Integration (Custom App Clients)
Option 1: Client uses REST APIs
‚Ä¢	Send cart & user data to /evaluate
‚Ä¢	Apply discount using response
Option 2: SDK Wrapper
‚Ä¢	Provide JS SDK for frontend use:
PromoEngine.init({ clientId: 'store_123' });
PromoEngine.evaluate(cart, user).then(res => ...);
Option 3: Shopify App
‚Ä¢	Embedded via App Bridge & ScriptTag
‚Ä¢	Auto-call /evaluate on cart load
________________________________________
11. üß† Custom Promotions & Client-Specific Rules
‚Ä¢	Each promotion rule links to client_id
‚Ä¢	Rules can use client-specific metafields or tags
‚Ä¢	If client needs specific logic:
o	Add custom condition resolvers (via plugin/hook system)
o	Allow injection of external data in evaluation context
________________________________________
12. ‚öñÔ∏è Flexibility & Scalability
‚Ä¢	Store rules in JSON = portable, versionable
‚Ä¢	Add custom resolvers for complex conditions
‚Ä¢	Multi-tenant via client_id
‚Ä¢	External webhook/event support
‚Ä¢	Allow caching for heavy cart evaluation logic
________________________________________
13. üöÄ Setup Instructions (End-to-End)
1.	Setup DB schema (3 tables: promotions, clients, applied_promotions)
2.	Build backend APIs using Node.js + Express + Prisma
3.	Build Admin UI (React or embed in Shopify app)
4.	Expose API to clients (secure via API keys)
5.	Clients send cart/user payload to /evaluate
6.	Apply discount on frontend via returned result
________________________________________
14. üìå Final Notes
‚Ä¢	Keep rules readable and testable
‚Ä¢	Add admin testing mode for previewing rules
‚Ä¢	Log every rule evaluation for analytics
‚Ä¢	Provide fallback in case of failure
